## About

This repo contains notes from [Chris Biscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi)'s Egghead Collection [Building a Serverless JAMStack Todo app with Netlify, Gatsby, GraphQL, and FaunaDB](https://egghead.io/playlists/building-a-serverless-jamstack-todo-app-with-netlify-gatsby-graphql-and-faunadb-53bb).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.


## Course Objective üí™

The goal of this collection is  to create a Jamstack application, including:
- a client application written with `gatsby`
- authentication with `netlify` Identity
- a `graphql` server on `netlify` Functions
- and a serverless, cloud-based database called `faunaDB`
