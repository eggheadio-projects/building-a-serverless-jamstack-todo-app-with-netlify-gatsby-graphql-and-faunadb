## Notes on Notes 🤓

This is a rather fast-paced course and some knowledge of React, the command line and GitHub is required to fully benefit from it. Chris will cover a lot of ground in just 13 videos and I recommended that you watch the collection several times. In between the main content (building the Jamstack application) Chris mentions several tips for improved worfklow, preferred tools and other recommendations that I've included in these notes as well. All in all, you will learn a lot, but try not to blink, or you might miss something 😃.

## What is Jamstack?

JamStack stands for:
- JavaScript
- APIs
- Markup

And so it is a "modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup".

## Who is Chris Biscardi? 👨‍💻

Chris helps early stage open-source based startups like Gatsby and Docker build products. He gets excited about open source, works across a full stack (from design to containers), and lifts heavy objects to relax.
